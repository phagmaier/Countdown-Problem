# Countdown-Problem:
Given a list of any size of unique numbers produce target value only using real numbers (no negative or fractions allowed)
## Official Rules

### Solution:

  #### Using a tree we find all possible solutions from each node 
  ### all possible solutions are found with no repeats 
  
### How to execute:
  #### Load program and execute main fuction entering in the numbers in a list as the first argument and the target number as the second number

### Improvments:
  #### Improve effiiency both in terms of speed and memory usage
  #### Remove uncecisary parts of the tree and node
  #### Find a way to remove the main function or at least the part where I have to generate a different tree for each specific number this is incredibly inefficient 
  #### If i'm not lazy I should add parentheses as it stands know when you read results you assume the everything is executed from left to right with no regard for presedence 
  #### Be able to enter in the input from the command line. This is also incredibly easy and if i wasn't so lazy i'd do that now
  #### Add visulization when as said above, I stop being lazy.
  
  #### Rewrite in Haskell see what is faster can probably do it more efficiently in haskell with minimal effort
